HEB side starts with list of all products, list of all curbside timeslots and their availabilities, and
potentially most recently completed order, plus user ids and such

may need to allow a single user to schedule multiple automations? would need to follow regular
curbside policy on multiple orders from single users, but excessive multiple parallel automated orders 
should be discouraged to prevent abuse

user indicates they want to opt-in to this auto ordering feature, starting with either their last
order's cart or a blank one if they do not have a last order. possibly need to store a most recent
automated order for if a user has previously used the autoprogram, withdrew, then wants to rejoin,
but this may only be an uncommon convenience with too much overhead for its value

user must still be able to use the curbside ordering system while an automated order is set, so 
saving most recent automated orders separate from regular ones may be better, even with the added 
overhead. user must be able to cancel automated orders in the same manner as nonautomated orders (user
needs to be informed this will not cancel future automated orders unless that setting is changed elsewhere).
user will be asked to allow two types of notifications if notifications are disabled, one for 
confirmation of successful ideal orders (this notification is not required to be enabled, and will 
occur X hours before pickup time, and X is chosen by the user and not larger than Y. Y is length of 
time between two automated orders minus a reasonable maximum processing time Z for the program (ex. 
orders on a two-week automation have a Y of two-weeks minus Z)) and one for nonideal orders (this 
notification is suggested to be required, as user input is desired in this case, but the program will 
work without this notification setting or user input on these errors)

user has the option to add items to this initial cart, then confirm the new reoccuring cart order and
the interval T it is ordered, and both ideal and acceptable timeslots 

sanitize user timeslot input, making sure they added at least one acceptable time

program should now run without user input unless errors occur or the user withdraws from the program

reserve timeslot, which requires asking the HEB side for availabilities in the user's ideal timeslots
(this should require locking the timeslot of edits until it is either determined to already be not 
available or newly reserved as a result of this program taking a slot for this order),
accepting any ideal reservation, checking acceptable timeslots if no ideal timeslots exist,
and needing to confirm with the user for anything other than ideal (reservations are still tentatively
made for timeslots within the preset acceptable times, but not outside them). User may be required to 
cancel the automated order if no reservation can be made. if the user confirms a reservation when asked,
the order is now considered ideal for this order only, but not future orders in these slots

without user confirmation, nonideal but acceptable reservations are locked in 2.5 hours before the slot
and now considered ideal for this order only, and nonacceptable orders are considered canceled for this
order only at some A time, A being subject to experimentation but not longer than Y. A may be the 
day before, 2.5 hours before the last acceptable timeslot in the automation period, 2.5 hours before 
the last ideal timeslot in the automation period, or some other arbitrary number

regular curbside pickup now occurs, including handling of errors by team members and potential 
rescheduling of missed orders, but this should never impact the automated ordering program unless
the user asks for a team member to withdraw the user from the automated program, which would need
its own program for team members to do so

at midnight after an automated order is scheduled to have been completed, regardless of rescheduling
done by team members for later dates of orders due to users missing curbside pickup appointments, loop
back to reserving the next timeslot for the next order following the user's T
(this time after the pickup and before midnight may need to be figured into Z, but is only especially 
important for daily orders, which may not be supported if it is determined that daily curbside orders 
from single users are not allowed within the scope of the program)
